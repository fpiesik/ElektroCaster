sentence=AsciiMassage is a microcontroller message packer and parser for the ASCII format in different protocols.  
paragraph=A massage message always starts with an address string and is followed by a user defined number of bytes, ints, longs, or floats.  The address string is used to route the message as in Open Sound Control. AsciiMassage is the ASCII implementation of the Massage API (https://github.com/SofaPirate/Massenger). Massages can be sent and received over different communication protocols such as serial, UDP, or web sockets. Includes examples for Cycling 74 Max, Processing, Websockets and UDP.
